It's been quite a rollercoaster of a year for me and my family. My wife and dad have both been fighting their own health battles, but thankfully, they're both on the mend now, which feels like a miracle.

Professionally, it's been a bit of a whirlwind too! I started a new job in February, but ended up going back to my old job in October. Even though the new gig didn't pan out, I'm really proud of what we accomplished during my time there.

On a geekier note, I got to dabble in some open source software contributions. They might be small, but hey, if you're using cbMailServices with the send-grid-protocol module and SendGrid's dynamic templates, you've got me to thank (no rush, though!).

Before I sign off, I just want to take a moment to send out a big Merry Christmas to those who celebrate, and a happy new year to all. Here's to hoping the next year brings joy and good health to everyone! ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ‰
