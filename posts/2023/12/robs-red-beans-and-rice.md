> A signature of Louisiana's Creole kitchen, Red Beans and Rice is more than just a dish; it's a Monday tradition. Crafted from kidney beans, a mix of vibrant veggies, and savory spices, this dish often incorporates the previous Sunday's pork leftovers. It's not uncommon to also find this meal enriched with ham, sausage, or tasso ham.

If you're craving a genuine Creole experience, here's a pocket-friendly recipe that promises deliciousness. Let's get started!

**Ingredients:**

*   1 pack red/kidney beans (16 oz)
*   1 medium onion, finely chopped
*   1 bell pepper, finely chopped
*   6 chopped celery ribs
*   1 tsp minced garlic
*   ½ Tbsp onion powder
*   ½ Tbsp garlic powder
*   2 bay leaves
*   6 cups chicken broth
*   1 pound Andouille sausage

**Estimated Cooking Time**: 3 hours

**Directions**:

1\. Begin by soaking your beans overnight to ensure they're tender. After draining, place them in a pot and combine with 6 cups of water and bouillon cubes. Introduce onion powder, garlic powder, and bay leaves at this stage.  
 
2\. Allow the pot to simmer on medium. Remember, the magic lies in a 'low and slow' cooking approach.

3\. Slice the Andouille sausage into bite-sized pieces. Even if pre-cooked, browning them in a skillet over medium heat will enhance their flavor. Transfer them to your simmering beans once done.

4\. In the same skillet, sauté the onions, bell peppers, and celery until they're translucent, absorbing the rich sausage flavor. Integrate these into the bean pot.

5\. Dedicate the next couple of hours to vigilant stirring, approximately every 20 minutes, to prevent the beans from sticking and burning. Using a sturdy spoon, gently crush some beans against the pot's wall to attain a creamier texture. Add water if the mixture seems too thick.

6\. As you approach the final hour, ensure frequent stirring. If the mixture has thickened substantially, you might want to introduce more water.

7\. Once cooked to perfection, serve your Red Beans over rice.

**Pro Tip**: While this dish tantalizes taste buds immediately, it's known to be even better the following day! Enjoy!
