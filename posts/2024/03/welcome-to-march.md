February was a very quiet month. I have been dealing with an expanding backlog of projects at work and it has impacted the amount of time I have to dedicate to side projects. Commandbox-ssg seems to be in a good spot, it has made it easy to manage my blog. I am still working on getting pagination working similar to Eleventy, but that is on hold until things slow down a bit or that functionality is requested.

I enjoyed my time getting the `commandbox-ssg` version of CFDocs up and running. I would say a lot of the functionality was there, but it is not completely functional (the runnable code demos are not so runnable). The [repo](https://github.com/robertz/cfdocs-ssg) is out there if you would like to play around with it.

Brad Wood and Ortus Solutions released [CommandBox 6.0.0](https://www.ortussolutions.com/blog/commandbox-600-released) on February 15th. I have installed the new release but I have not really had time to dive in to it, especially the multi-site servers. I always develop locally on Commmandbox, but I would typically use the Lucee installer on the VPS. It looks like those days are gone forever now. I can also appreciate the ability to specify package and server scripts as an array.

Raymond Camden also had a cool session on &lt;code&gt;&lt;br&gt;, [Shall we play a game?](https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-02202024/), all about writing text based video games in javascript. Years ago I helped Ray with [Idle Fleet](https://idlefleet.netlify.app), a cool little idle clicker game. If I am being honest I think I fixed a message, but I helped. ðŸ¤£

Ray  will be hosting another session March 5th, [Playing Games with Alpine.js](https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-03052024/). I have been looking for a reason to pickup Alpine.js and this seems as good an excuse as any. I intend on being there to heckle Ray and learn some cool stuff, come check it out!
